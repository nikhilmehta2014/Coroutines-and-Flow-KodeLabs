What is a function?
A function is a sequence of instructions that takes inputs and gives output(s).

What is a Thread?
A thread describes in which context this sequence of instructions should be executed.

If 2 threads are executing a given function at some point of time, we cannot predict their order and speed.

Why do we need Coroutines?
* Multithreading
* Network calls
* Database operations
* Complex calculations

Why Coroutines over Threads?
1. Coroutines execute within a Thread, hence we can start many Coroutines inside a single Thread. Coroutines are light weight threads.
2. Coroutines are suspendable, which means we can execute some instructions, pause it and resume it later. Threads cannot fo that.
3. Coroutines can switch their context.
